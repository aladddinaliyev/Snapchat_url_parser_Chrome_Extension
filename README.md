# 🔍 Snapchat URL Parser — Chrome Extension

A lightweight Chrome extension that parses and logs URL parameters on [Snapchat Accounts](https://accounts.snapchat.com).  
It helps developers and researchers extract parameters like `client_id`, `continue`, and more directly from the current page.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Automatically parses URL parameters on `accounts.snapchat.com`
- Displays key parameters (`continue`, `client_id`, `captchaChallenge`, etc.) in the browser console
- Works as a **content script**, no background worker required
- Simple setup and runs entirely client-side
